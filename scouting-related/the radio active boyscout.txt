The Radioactive Boy Scout story is about David Hahn, a teenage prodigy in Michigan who, while trying to earn an Atomic Energy merit badge, attempted to build a homemade nuclear breeder reactor in his backyard shed in the mid-1990s, collecting radioactive materials from household items like smoke detectors and lanterns, eventually leading to a federal Superfund cleanup of his property due to dangerous radiation levels
. This true story of ambition and scientific overreach became the basis for Ken Silverstein's book, The Radioactive Boy Scout, detailing how his quest for nuclear power created an environmental hazard. 
Key Details of the Story:

    The Boy Scout: David Hahn, fascinated by science, sought to build a working breeder reactor to demonstrate nuclear power.
    Materials Collected: He gathered radioactive isotopes like thorium (from lantern mantles), americium (from smoke detectors), and radium (from old clock dials).
    The Reactor: He assembled these into a crude device in a shed, but his experiments began emitting dangerously high radiation levels, creating a local environmental crisis.
    The Discovery: Police discovered his project in 1994 during a traffic stop, leading to an EPA response and the hazardous cleanup of his shed and backyard.
    The Book: Journalist Ken Silverstein chronicled Hahn's story in The Radioactive Boy Scout, highlighting scientific ambition, youthful hubris, and the potential dangers of unchecked scientific curiosity. 

Outcome:

    The EPA declared the shed a Superfund hazardous waste site, burying the contaminated materials in a special dump in Utah.
    Hahn's life after the incident involved military service, though he was kept away from nuclear-related roles, and his story serves as a cautionary tale about nuclear safety and responsibility, notes PBS and Scientific American
